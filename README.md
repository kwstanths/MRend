# MRend
MRend is a Molecular Visualization Unity application, developed for molecule interaction and information extraction in Virtual Reality
This application features:
- Parsing and visualizing the atoms from .pdb files
- Creating and spawning bonds between atoms
- Visualizing the scene in Space-filling or Ball-and-stick representation
- High quality rendering of ray-casting based impostor objects, spheres and cylinders in Unity
- A 2D interaction method for selecting nearby objects, without ray-casting to them
- Visualization of atom distances, bond angles, and torsion angles
- A world space UI that disregards occlusion on demand
